    <b>How do I leave feedback?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    Leaving feedback is a huge component of Trinity Tutor. We hope that Users of the website leave thoughtful, constructive feedback for both Tutors and Tutees. After you have selected a Tutor and received the help you need, you can click the link "Submit Feedback" on the post you created. Here you can leave a rating from one to five, with five being the highest possible rating, as well as comments about the experience. Your Tutor can also submit feedback on you as well. This feedback will be part of your Tutee rating. You will also have two ratings - one as a Tutor and one as a Tutee, which are calculated separately. Ratings are calculated by taking the average of all the ratings you have received thus far as a User of Trinity Tutor.
